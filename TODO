* Make inter-op easier when starting with a NULL-terminated char buf
  * add a constructor that takes the existing char_buf, char_buf_size?
    * is it handy to have it realloc if runs out of space?
* Consider converting the struct from an opaque pointer in strbuf.c to a
  user-visible structure in strbuf.h
* Consider re-structure for easier use
  * it's irritating to have to add to a Makefile commands like:
      CFLAGS += -I libstrbuf/src \
		-I libstrbuf/submodules/libecheck/src
      CFILES += libstrbuf/src/strbuf.c \
		libstbuf/submodules/libecheck/src/eembed.c
  * linking the source of the submodules in to src/ maybe?
